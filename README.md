# Sales-Analysis

### A data analyst using Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 3 years' worth of sales data. The data contains thousands of store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

- What is the overall sales trend? 
- Which are the Top 10 products by sales?
- Which are the Most Selling Products?
- Which is the most preferred Ship Mode?
- 1Which are the Most Profitable Category and Sub-Category?

To answer these questions, I walk through many different pandas & matplotlib and seaborn library methods. They include:
- Adding columns
- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
- Using the .apply() method
- Using group by to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
